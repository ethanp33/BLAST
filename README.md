## 1. Installing Python

Firstly, to run these scripts you must install Python. You can install standalone Python. Or, if you are planning on doing lots of data science in Python, you can install Anaconda which packages Python alongside libraries useful for data science.
- [Standalone Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

## 2. Importing Packages into Standalone Python

1. Open Command Prompt if you are a Windows user, or open Terminal if you are a Mac user.
2. You will need to install each package individually using PIP, which is an in-built package manager for Python.
3. Install the below packages by entering these commands individually:
   - `pip install biopython`
