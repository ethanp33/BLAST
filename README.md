## 1. Installing Python

Firstly, to run these scripts you must install Python. You can install standalone Python. Or, if you are planning on doing lots of data science in Python, you can install Anaconda which packages Python alongside libraries useful for data science.
- [Standalone Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

## 2. Importing Packages into Standalone Python

1. Open Command Prompt if you are a Windows user, or open Terminal if you are a Mac user.
2. You will need to install each package individually using PIP, which is an in-built package manager for Python.
3. Install the below packages by entering these commands individually:
   - `pip install biopython`
   - `pip install pandas`
   - `pip install lxml`
   - `pip install numpy`

## 3. Importing Packages into Anaconda

1. Open Anaconda Prompt.
2. You will need to install each package individually using PIP, which is an in-built package manager for Python.
3. All of the packages used in these scripts are already included in Anaconda, however it is worthwhile upgrading each package incase it is out of date or missing by entering these commands individually:
   - `pip install biopython --upgrade`
   - `pip install pandas --upgrade`
   - `pip install lxml --upgrade`
   - `pip install numpy --upgrade`
4. If any of the packages are not installed, you can install them by entering these commandy individually:
   - `pip install biopython`
   - `pip install pandas`
   - `pip install lxml`
   - `pip install numpy`

## 4. Downloading Biopython-Scripts

1. Click the green code button above, then select download ZIP. Or alternatively, click [this](https://github.com/ethanp33/Biopython-Scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the necessary files directly.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a location of your choice, make sure to remember where you extracted this!
3. Open the `Biopython-Scripts-main` foldder in the location in which you extracted the ZIP file.
4. Inside you will notice various files and folders:
   - `__pychace__` - Ignore this folder! There is nothing of use here :)
   - `downloads` -
